# SVD_NMF_CNN_MNIST
The linear algebra method has been used widely in different areas, such as engineering analysis,
high performance computing, chemical/genetic pathways study and computational animation.
Matrix manipulation technique is one of the most used methods in different applications and the one
we are going to study in this report. MNIST [1], a classic dataset in machine learning especially
classification, is employed in this work. It provides us opportunities to try the real-world data
without spending too much time on data cleansing and not be limited by the computational power.
In this work, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
are used in the classic MNIST classification problem. nMNIST dataset [2] is employed in this study
to test the stability of different methods, the definition of stability will be introduced later in report.
In addition, two certain architectures Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is also used in the same
problem to compare with SVD and NMFâ€™s performance (accuracy and stability) as a case study
